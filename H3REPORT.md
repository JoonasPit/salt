## H3

This was all written in markdown, as the assignment ordered.
The machine used for the assigment was my Acer Aspire V laptop running a Xubuntu 18.04 LTS OS. Minions will be reported later on as

the exercise goes on.


# C) Put the /srv/salt/ folder in to github.

I started the exercise by running the git --conf user.email and user.name commands to create a git user on my personal machine
I had already installed git earlier to share some code with a friend of mine so no installation was required, but to install git run 

'sudo apt -y install git'
